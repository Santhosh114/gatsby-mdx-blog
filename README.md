# [SanthoshSoundar.blog](https://santhoshsoundar.blog/)
This is my over engineered Data Visualization blog built with Gatsby.js, an amazing react.js based site generator that managed to blow me away coming from Jekyll counterparts. 

There has always been a lack of solid blogging engines for the data viz community, eg. [Adam Pearce](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce) built his own [blogging engine to write and visualize](https://roadtolarissa.com/literate-blogging/).

I saw ways to maintain data viz profile with [bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/)/[BlockBuilder](https://blockbuilder.org/search) or [Observeable](https://beta.observablehq.com/), but I wanted something more & Gatsby came to my rescue & with MDX support this took shape as a powerful medium to publish d3+react.js based contents on the blog posts. 

## Gatsby
At the core of this blog is [Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/), as described, it allows building blazing fast sites sites with react and introduces a ton of features like progressive image loading ie. lazzy loading images with medium.com like [blured up image rendering](https://codebushi.com/using-gatsby-image/) with the help of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) that is baked in gatsby for content fetching. 

## MDX
This was not possible without this amazing project - [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) that lets bloging engine to include react components with-in the post.md files by extending them to post.mdx that could hold have react magic. Special thanks to [ChristopherBiscardi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi) who made MDX possible and responding to my integration issues.
